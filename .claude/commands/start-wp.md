Start work on a new work package. Create a branch, read the relevant agent briefing, and begin implementation.

Steps:
1. Ask which work package number to start (WP1, WP2, WP3, etc.)
2. Create a git branch: `wp<N>/<short-description>`
3. Read the corresponding agent file from `.claude/agents/`
4. Read `docs/architecture/TECH_DECISIONS.md` for binding decisions
5. Read `docs/architecture/DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql` for relevant tables
6. Present a plan: what you'll build, in what order, and what tests you'll write
7. Wait for approval before writing any code
